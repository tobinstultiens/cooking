# Chocolate Cookies
[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPMUZAeI7no)
## Ingredients
- 220g nice butter
- 100g granulated sugar
- 200g dark brown sugar
- 2 large eggs + 1 yolk
- 4g vanilla extract
- 226g of 70% cacao nice baking chocolate (bars not chips)
- 330g (or 2 1/3 cups) All purpose flour
- 1/2 teas baking soda
- 1/4 teas baking powder
- 7g salt
- flakey salt for topping


## Steps
1. Into the bowl of a stand mixer, add room temperature butter and the sugars. Using the paddle attachment, cream for 4-5 minutes on medium high. Then add in eggs + yolk and vanilla and cream on high for another 30-60 seconds (pausing to scrape down the sides of the bowl halfway through). Creaming times will vary slightly based on the temperature of your product. At the end of the creaming, your mixture should look the way it does in the video.
2. Roughly chop the chocolate. Transfer the chocolate into a  colander or salad spinner and gently shake to remove some of the fine grains of chocolate so you're left with mostly the large chunks.
3. Add flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt and mix on low for about 30 seconds. Reserve 15-20 chocolate chunks and gently fold the rest into the mixture until well distributed.
4. Using a 4oz scoop or 1/2c measuring cup, scoop cookies onto a small tray, dropping a couple of chocolate chunks into the bottom of the scooper before scooping. Refrigerate for 4-12 hours.
5. When you're ready for baking, preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place cookies on two flat, parchment-lined baking sheets. I do 4 cookies per sheet since these are LARGE cookies and need room to spread. Top each cookie with a sprinkle of flakey salt. Bake for around 18 minutes or until edges are golden brown, but soft in the middle.

## Notes
- The dough can be stored in de freezer for up to 5 days.
