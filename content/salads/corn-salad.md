4. Add the juice of 1 lime, 2 tablespoons of light mayo and the spices to the bowl and mix everything together.
5. Dice the avocado and optionally add it to the bowl (this depends on how long you want to store this salad) together with the feta cheese and mix everything together.

# Some alternative variations:

- Add some diced jalapenos for a spicy kick.
- Use a different type of beans, such as kidney beans or pinto beans, instead of black beans.
- Add some diced tomatoes for extra freshness and flavor.
