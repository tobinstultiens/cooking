Ingredients:
- 1 small hot-dog or submarine roll, per person (about 5"/12.5cm long)
- A bit of Pesto at the bottom
- Dried oregano
- Fresh lettuce leaves (of your choice)
- 1 small vine-ripened tomato per person (thinly sliced)
- 1/4 red onion, per person (very thinly sliced)
- 25g Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese per person (shaved into thin slices with a vegetable peeler)
- 2 slices of Prosciutto di Parma per person
- Sea salt and ground black pepper, to taste

I would have enjoyed it more with rucola
