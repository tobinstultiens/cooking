- Cut half a root of washed burdock into small slices and add to the water straight away (to avoid it oxidizing) ginger can also be substituted instead of burdock
- Cut half an onion into thin slices and add to the liquid as well
- Turn to a high heat with the lid on
- Once it starts to boil, add your thinly sliced beef and cook for a few minutes until cooked through
- Let the Beef Stew in the sauce for around 5 minutes

If you want to make onsen tamago:
- Heat up water in a saucepan to 65C or 150F (don’t let it boil!)
- Add your eggs to the saucepan and leave for 30 minutes
