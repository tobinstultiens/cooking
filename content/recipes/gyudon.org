- Cut half an onion into thin slices and add to the liquid as well
- Turn to a high heat with the lid on
- Once it starts to boil, add your thinly sliced beef and cook for a few minutes until cooked through

If you want to make onsen tamago:

- Add your eggs to the saucepan and leave for 30 minutes
