# Pickled Red Onions
This is a nice acidic [recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4HbmPu_M_4&t=24s).

## Ingredients:
- Red onions
- 1 part vinegar
- 1 part water
- Big pinch of salt

## Steps:
1) Very thinly slice the red onions from root to stem and add them to a jar.
2) Add equal parts vinegar and water to a pot (enough to cover the onions)  with a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and pour over the onions.
3) Cover and let sit in the fridge for at least 2 hours before serving. The pink color will get deeper the longer they sit.
4) Put them on everything.
