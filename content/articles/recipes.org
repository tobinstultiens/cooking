** Marcella Hazan's 3 Ingredient Tomato Sauce
[[https://www.ethanchlebowski.com/cooking-techniques-recipes/marcella-hazans-3-ingredient-tomato-sauce][Link]]

Ingredients:
- 1 28 oz can quality whole peeled tomatoes
- 5 TBSP of butter
- 1 onion
- Coarse Kosher Salt

To serve with pasta:
- Fresh basil, chiffonade
- Small handful of Parmigiano Reggiano
- 1/2 lb Bucatini
- 1/4 cup reserved pasta water

Steps:\\
Make Ahead Method:
1) Crush the whole peeled tomatoes with a food mill or blender (optional)
2) Add the tomatoes, butter, and onion to a large skillet over medium-low heat.
3) Stirring occasionally, let the sauce simmer until it is reduced and thickened, about 30 minutes.
4) The sauce can be stored in the fridge for about a week.

To serve with pasta:
1) Bring 3 quarts / liter of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 30 grams of salt or 1.5 TBSP if using Morton's coarse kosher salt (3 large pinches for me). Once the water has boiled, add the pasta and set a timer for 1-2 minutes less than the package says. Make sure to stir the pasta a few times in the first several minutes to avoid sticking. When the pasta is done, scoop off 1 cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta.
2) Add the red sauce to a pan over medium low heat with chiffonade basil and a small handful of parmigiano reggiano. Let cook, while stirring, for 2 minutes.
3) Add the bucatini, and reserved pasta water. Vigorously stir until the sauce completely coats the pasta.
4) Plate and serve with more fresh basil and parmigiano reggiano.

** Chicken Kathi Roll With Green Chutney
[[https://www.ethanchlebowski.com/cooking-techniques-recipes/chicken-kathi-rolls][Link]]
Marinated Chicken:
- 6 Boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 10 g Salt
- 3 g MSG
- Juice from 1/2 lime
- (4 g) Spoonful of ground cumin
- (2 g) Spoonful Kashmiri chili powder (or cayenne)
- (1 g) 1/2 Spoonful of turmeric
- 15 cranks black pepper
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1-inch knob of ginger, crushed
- 10 g tomato paste
- 50 g plain yogurt

INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Set the oven on broil over high.
2) Add the peeled garlic cloves and knob of ginger to a mortar and pestle and bash into a rough paste.
3) Cut the chicken into small cubes and add them to a large mixing bowl along with the salt, msg (if using), lime juice, ground cumin, chili powder, turmeric, black pepper, garlic, ginger, tomato paste, and plain yogurt. Mix well and coat every piece. Note: Cover and marinate in the fridge overnight for best results.
4) Get out a baking sheet and evenly space the chicken so none of the pieces are touching, this will help with even cooking and better browning. Place under the broiler and cook for about 8 to 10 minutes during which some charred pieces should develop. Take them out and flip with a spatula once before cooking for another couple of minutes. Then set aside.
5) While the chicken is cooking, prepare the chutney. Add the lime juice, roma tomato, salt, green chiles, a handful of cilantro, the mint leaves, and grated coconut to a blender and pulse until completely smooth. Thin out with water as needed. Taste it! Add more salt or citrus juice as needed.
6) Set a pan over medium heat and add some ghee or oil. Place a frozen or fresh-made paratha and gently cook until golden brown and crispy on both sides. Note: If you want to make it an egg roll, scramble one egg and pour it on one side of the golden brown paratha. Flip once and cook the egg face down before assembling the Kathi roll.
7) Assemble the roll. Spread a spoonful or two of the chutney on the bottom followed by a serving of the chicken. Garnish with pickled onions, thinly sliced cucumber, and more chutney as needed.
