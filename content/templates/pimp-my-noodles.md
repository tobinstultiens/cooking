This is a simple guide on how to pimp your instant [noodles](https://www.budgetbytes.com/6-ways-to-upgrade-instant-ramen/).

Ingredients:

- 1/2 tsp grated ginger
- 250 ml broth
- 250 ml water

Steps:
1. Add the oil, garlic, and ginger to a small sauce pot and sauté over medium for about one minute.
2. Add your vegetable of choice and saute for about a minute.
3. Add the broth and water, and bring to a boil.
4. Now make your broth your own add sauces to the broth and taste whether this is what you like. My personal favorite thing to add is sriracha and chicken bouillon as broth.
5. Crack the egg into the broth for about a minute, then add your instant noodles for 3 minutes.
6. Transfer the soup to a bowl, then top it with sliced green onion.
